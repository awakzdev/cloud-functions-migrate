## Purpose and use case

- The purpose of this code is to automatically sync Pub\Sub and Google Cloud Function to your local environment. 
- Aid in the process of migration from one GCP environment to another using Terraform.


## Authentication

In order to use this code, you will need to authenticate with Google Cloud. You can do this by using the following command:
```
gcloud auth application-default login
```

Once you have completed authentication, you should be able to use this code to sync data between different sources.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Wthin '.env' set the `PROJECT` and `REGION` environment variables to the ID of your Google Cloud project and the region where you want to deploy your functions.
